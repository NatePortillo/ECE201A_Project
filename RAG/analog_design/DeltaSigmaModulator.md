# Delta Sigma Modulator ADC
A delta sigma modulator is a circuit consisting of several existing components including an opamp and a latched comparator. The latched compartor includes a d flip flop and a strong arm latch. All these components can be directly imported. The outputs of the opamp should be connected to the inputs of the latched comparator.
Delta-sigma (ΔΣ; or sigma-delta, ΣΔ) modulation is an oversampling method for encoding signals into low bit depth digital signals at a very high sample-frequency as part of the process of delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Delta-sigma modulation achieves high quality by utilizing a negative feedback loop during quantization to the lower bit depth that continuously corrects quantization errors and moves quantization noise to higher frequencies well above the original signal's bandwidth. Subsequent low-pass filtering for demodulation easily removes this high frequency noise and time averages to achieve high accuracy in amplitude which can be ultimately encoded as pulse-code modulation (PCM).
