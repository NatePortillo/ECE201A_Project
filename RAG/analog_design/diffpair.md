# Differential Pair or diffpair
A differential pair is an amplifier used to amplify the difference between two voltage input signals. It uses two nmos or pmos transistors, with their sources shorted together. This kind of amplifier is able to achieve high gain and high input impedance. The single-ended output is taken from one end of the pair.
## Place
a differential pair consists of two transistors, one for the positive side and one for the negative side
## Routing
differential pair only has one route which is source to source
