# make a rf pair
place a resistor called rf1
place a resistor called rf2
# make a ri pair
place a resistor called ri1
place a resistor called ri2
# make the capacitor pair
place a mimcap called c1 
place a mimcap called c2
move rf2 right next to rf1
move ri1 below rf2
move ri2 right next to ri1
move ri2 below rf2
move c1 right next to ri2
move c2 right next to ri2
move c2 below rf2
# Short the terminals of the rf ri resistor pairs
route between ri1_pfet_multiplier_0_gate_W and rf1_pfet_multiplier_0_drain_W using c_route
route between ri2_pfet_multiplier_0_gate_W and rf2_pfet_multiplier_0_drain_W using c_route
# Connect rf-ri junction to capacitor
route between rf1_pfet_multiplier_0_gate_W and c1_top_met_W using c_route with extension=2
route between ri2_pfet_multiplier_0_gate_E and c2_top_met_W using snake_route
