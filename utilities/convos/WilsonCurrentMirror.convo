// create parameters: wcm_length, wcm_fingers
Create a float parameter called wcm_length
Create an int parameter called wcm_fingers
// place
place 4 interdigitated transistors called wcm with numcols=wcm_fingers, length=wcm_length, top_row_device="nfet", bottom_row_device="nfet"
// only one component placed, so no move
